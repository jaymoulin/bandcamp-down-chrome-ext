*IMPORTANT UPDATE*: Google finally deleted the extension from its webstore since it's not compliant with their policy (and I agree with this decision).

However, you can still install the extension manually : [https://jaymoulin.me/me/keeptune/](https://jaymoulin.me/me/keeptune/) or Early Access [https://www.patreon.com/jaymoulin?filters[tag]=keeptune](https://www.patreon.com/jaymoulin?filters[tag]=keeptune).

Please, feel free to make donations, this will help me continuing making useful apps ;)

This Google Chrome extension allows you to easily download albums you can listen on Bandcamp, Soundcloud and more to come

Bug report and suggestions are welcome on this URL : [https://github.com/jaymoulin/keeptune/issues](https://github.com/jaymoulin/keeptune/issues).

## What it looks like

when you visit a page with a listenable album, a notification will appear to download the album :

![A wild notification appeared!](https://jaymoulin.me/me/keeptune/images/notif-1.png "A wild notification appeared!")

Just click on it to download the album

![Download in progress](https://jaymoulin.me/me/keeptune/images/notif-2.png "Download in progress")

![Zip downloaded](https://jaymoulin.me/me/keeptune/images/zip.png "Zip downloaded")

![All files in a great folder hierarchy](https://jaymoulin.me/me/keeptune/images/folder.png "All files in a great folder hierarchy")

## Update 1.0.0

Huge refactoring so we can now handle Soundcloud!

## Update 0.3.0

You can now configure the extension with the notification you want to see.

Also, a new download page allows you to download multiple albums at the same time and retry tracks that failed to download.
This page offers you really cool options to ease album downloading !
